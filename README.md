# Let us Unveil Network Intrusion Features: Enhancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems via XAI-based Feature Selection

# Abstract 
The lack of performance evaluation and explainability of artificial
intelligence (AI) models for intrusion detection systems (IDS) is a
significant concern for human security analysts. In this context,
feature selection is a crucial aspect of IDS where extracting the most
significant features is essential for enhancing the performance of
intrusion detection and understanding the main attributes that
identify anomalies in network security. In this study, we address
such challenge of feature selection for IDS where we propose
novel methods for feature selection using explainable AI (XAI)
methods. We extract the most important features of different AI
models and develop five novel feature selection methods from them.
To evaluate our approach, we assess seven black-box AI models
using two real-world network intrusion datasets. We establish
a baseline without feature selection and gradually reduce the
feature sets. We also compare our XAI-based feature selection
methods with different state-of-the-art feature selection methods
where we demonstrate that most AI models exhibit superior
performance when utilizing the top significant features selected
by our framework. Our work offers innovative feature selection
methods and provides a foundation for different XAI-based
approaches which can help network security analysts in making
more informed decisions based on knowledge of top intrusion
features. We release our source codes, offering a baseline XAI-based
feature selection framework for the community to expand upon
with new models. Our work provides an important contribution
towards the development of interpretable AI models for network
intrusion detection tasks by enhancing feature selection.

### Note: From here below Excel was used to compute feature selection
### Common features by overall rank

This method each feature rank for the models to create only one overall feature rank for all models. This is achieved by calculating the average rank of each individual feature across all AI models.

### Common features by overall weighted rank

This method builds upon the previous one. However, the difference is that it takes into consideration the SHAP values for each feature and the accuracy for each AI model, instead of the sequential numeration.
The importance of feature is calculated by the sum of the product of SHAP value and accuracy of that AI model for that feature. Then, the features are ranked according to average of that sum.

### Common features by overall normalized weighted rank

This method is the same as the last one but with one difference. It normalizes all the SHAP values. During the experiments it was noted that some models such as LightGBM results in SHAP values with values that are much bigger others ones. Therefore, the normalization step was added to avoid such bias.

### Models + Attacks ranking score

This methods extracts significant intrusion features via selecting the top-ùëò ranked features across all different AI models and all different intrusion types. Suppose the set of AI intrusion detection models is denoted by M in which each entry ùëö ‚àà M represents one black-box AI model and that the set of intrusion types be given by A in which ùëé ‚àà A represents one intrusion class. We calculate the overall ranking score of each feature (given by ùëüùëñ) as follows:

![image](https://github.com/ogarreche/XAI_Feature_Selection_ACSAC_23/blob/main/images/form6.png?raw=true)

Where ùëüùëñùëö and ùëüùëñùëé are the ranks of feature ùëñ for model ùëö ‚àà M and intrusion ùëé ‚àà A, respectively. The overall ranking score of a feature ùëñ (ùëüùëñ) is given by the weighted sum of both the feature rank across all AI models and across all intrusion types. We then chose the ùëò features with lowest rank value. Note that the lower ùëüùëñ, the higher the feature rank.

### Combined selection (Takes in consideration the seven methods used before)

In this method, we give a weight to each feature that depends on the frequency of appearance of this feature among top-ùëò features in all proposed feature selection methods. In other words, the selection of feature here depends on its combined importance among all other proposed methods. We next show well known feature selection methods that are used in this work as baselines to our proposed methods. For these
methods, most of them do no need to train models beforehand.

### Example Program:

In the Example folder, first run both RF.ipynb and Light.ipynb to generate the SHAP graph and feature importance list. Then Check the Example.xlsx to generate the proposed methods (this process is manual). After completing this step, there will be new features list (common features by overall rank, etc) to be used again in the RF.ipynb and Light.ipynb to generate the metrics considering such features.
